Servlet for converting documents

Installation instructions:
- If no web server is available you should install your favourite web server.
- Download the servlet support Java archive (cos.jar) from 
http://www.servlets.com/cos/index.html and copy the file to the directory 
<OFFICE_HOME>/program/classes. Also make these classes known to your web server.
- Make sure the Servlet API is in the classpath of your web server. You can 
download the Servlet API from http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/index.html . 
Also, you must copy the file "servlet.jar" to the directory <OFFICE_HOME>/program/classes.
- Use your GNU make (http://www.gnu.org) to build the servlet class.
- Make the servlet class known to your web server.

Converting documents with the servlet:
- In the file "ConverterServlet.html", search for the following line:
<form action="http://127.0.0.1:8100/servlet/ConverterServlet" method=post enctype="multipart/form-data">
Replace the existing IP address with your intended IP address.
- Open the file "ConverterServlet.html" in your web browser and select a file,
a type to convert the file to, and the extension for the converted file.
- Press the button. The document will be uploaded to the server, converted and
pushed back to the client. Your browser will open a dialog for saving the
converted document.
