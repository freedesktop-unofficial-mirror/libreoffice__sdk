		General Handling
		----------------

- The developer inserts the OpenOffice.org version intop the @since tag.

- @since-Tag may contain any string which needs to end with a Version number.
  The first cipher following immediately on a white space is interpreted as start of the version number.

- The @since Tag must stay completely within one line to allow tool support for retargeting.

- To see @since entries in the generated documentation, one needs to use the command line option
  
  -sincefile <file-path>

  This option has to occur immediately after the -html option.




		Format of the @since Tag Transformation File
		--------------------------------------------
