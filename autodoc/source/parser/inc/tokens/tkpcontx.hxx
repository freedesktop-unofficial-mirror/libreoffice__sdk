/**	@task
    Specifies a context within which tokens are interpreted in a special
    way. For example in parsing C++ there could be a context for code,
    one for comments and a third one for preprocessor statements, because
    each of these would give the same token different meanings.

    The three functions
            ReadCharChain()
            PassNewToken()
            FollowUpContext()
    have to be called in this sequence.

    /** @descr
        The functions starts to parse with the CurChar() of io_rText.
        It leaves io_rText.CurChar() at the first char of the following Token or
        the following Context.

        This function returns, when a context has parsed some characterss
        and completed a token OR left the context.
        If the token is to be ignored, it is cut from io_rText.

        If the token is to be parsed further in a different context,
        it is NOT cut from io_rText.

        After this function PassNewToken() has to be called.

        If the function has found a valid and complete token, PassNewToken()
        passes the parsed token to the internally known receiver and
        returns true. The token is cut from io_rText.
