/**	@task
    Specifies a context within which tokens are interpreted in a special
    way. For example in parsing C++ there could be a context for code,
    one for comments and a third one for preprocessor statements, because
    each of these would give the same token different meanings.

    The three functions
            ReadCharChain()
            PassNewToken()
            FollowUpContext()
    have to be called in this sequence.

        The functions starts to parse with the CurChar() of io_rText.
        It leaves io_rText.CurChar() at the first char of the following Token or
        the following Context.

        This function returns, when a context has parsed some characterss
        and completed a token OR left the context.
        If the token is to be ignored, it is cut from io_rText.

        If the token is to be parsed further in a different context,
        it is NOT cut from io_rText.

        After this function PassNewToken() has to be called.

        If the function has found a valid and complete token, PassNewToken()
        passes the parsed token to the internally known receiver and
        returns true. The token is cut from io_rText.
