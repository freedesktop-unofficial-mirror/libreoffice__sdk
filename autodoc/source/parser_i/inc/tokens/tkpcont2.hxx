    Specifies a context within which tokens are interpreted in a special

    one for comments and a third one for preprocessor statements, because
    each of these would give the same token different meanings.

    /** @descr
        The functions starts to parse with the CurToken() of io_rText.
        It leaves io_rText at the first char of the following Token or
        the following Context.

        This function returns, when a context has parsed some characterss
        and completed a token OR left the context.
        If the token is to be ignored, PassNewToken() returns false
        and cuts the token from io_rText.
        If the token is to be parsed further in a different context,
        PassNewToken() returns false, but the token is
        NOT cut from io_rText.

        If the function has found a valid and complete token, PassNewToken()
        passes the parsed token to the internally known receiver and
        returns true. The token is cut from io_rText.
