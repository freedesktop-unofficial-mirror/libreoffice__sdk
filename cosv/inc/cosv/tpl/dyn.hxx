/** Dyn owns an object on the heap, which will be automatically
    deleted in its D'tor.

    Dyn's main purpose is for class members on the heap:
    You can't forget to delete them in the D'tor. Constness will be transfered
    to the hold object.

    Dyn forbids the CopyC'tor and operator=(). So you can't incidentally
    run into problems with compiler defined CopyC'tor or operator=() of the
    owning class. If you need those, you have to define them explicitely - as
    you should do anyway with all classes, that own members on the heap.

    Dyn also works with incomplete types.
    You only need to write
    class DX;
    but needn't include  #include <DX>.hxx.
    This is a difference to std::auto_ptr, where it is not absolutely clear
    if it is allowed to use it with incomplete types.

    You can also use Dyn within function bodies, to make them exception safe.

    @attention
    If you use Dyn with an incomplete type, the owning class needs to
    define a non-inline D'tor. Else the compiler will complain.
